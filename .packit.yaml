# NOTE: The Packit copr_build tasks help to check if every commit builds on
# supported Fedora and CentOS Stream arches.
# They do not block the current Cirrus-based workflow.

# Build targets can be found at:
# https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/packit-builds/
# and
# https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rhcontainerbot/podman-next/
